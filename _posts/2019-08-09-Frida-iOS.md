How to use Frida in iOS devices: command line, Frida Gadget and scripts (JavaScript and Python).




# Frida
Itâ€™s a dynamic code instrumentation toolkit. It lets you inject snippets of JavaScript or your own library into native apps on Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX. Frida also provides you with some simple tools built on top of the Frida API. These can be used as-is, tweaked to your needs, or serve as examples of how to use the API.
* [Installation](https://www.frida.re/docs/installation/)
* [Tutorial](https://www.frida.re/docs/ios/)
* [Examples](https://www.frida.re/docs/examples/ios/)

## Commands (via USB)
Show all the applications of the device
```
frida-ps -Uai
```

Starts the Frida Gadget
```
frida -U APP_NAME
```

Script injection
```
frida -U -l SCRIPT.js APP_NAME
```

Tracing native APIs (partial method name with wildcards allowed)
```
frida-trace -U APP_NAME -i "METHOD_NAME"$
```

Tracing Objective-C metods (partial method and class name with wildcards allowed)
```
$ frida-trace -U APP_NAME -m "-[CLASS_NAME METHOD_NAME]"
```

Execute Objective-C commands from terminal
```
frida -q -U APP_NAME -e "COMMAND"
```

## JavaScript API
Get instance object
```
var instance = ObjC.chooseSync(ObjC.classes.CLASS_NAME)[0];
```

Call method
```
instance.METHOD_NAME();
```

Dump the entire view hierarchy of a window
```
w = ObjC.classes.UIWindow.keyWindow()
desc = w.recursiveDescription().toString()
```

Application installation path
```
ObjC.classes[CLASS_NAME].$moduleName;
```

Class methods
```
ObjC.classes[CLASS_NAME].$ownMethods;
```

Mapping each instance variable name to its current value
```
ObjC.classes[CLASS_NAME].$ivars;
```


## Javascript
Call method (inside onEnter or onLeave)
```
var obj = new ObjC.Object(arg[0]);
obj.METHOD_NAME();
```

Print class and method
```
this._className = ObjC.Object(args[0]).toString();
this._methodName = ObjC.selectorAsString(args[1]);
console.log('Detected call to:');
console.log('   ' + this._className + ' --> ' + this._methodName);
```

Modify return value
```
returnValue.replace(ptr(NEW_VALUE));
```


# Scripts
The following scripts can be found in my [Github Trelis24](https://github.com/trelis24/frida-ios)

## start_frida.py
Python script that given a script and a app bundle, it starts the app, inject de script and resume the execution.

## find_classes.js
Search for classes
* If no strings are specified in "search_class" array, the script will print all the classes.
* If one or more strings are specified in "search_class array", the script will only print classes which contains the strings in their name.


## find_methods.js
Search for methods
* If no strings are specified in "search_class" nor "search_method" arrays, the script will print the methods of all the classes (frida server might stop running if there are a lot of	classes).
* If one or more strings are specified in "search_class array", the script will print the methods of the classes which contains the strings in their name.
* If one or more strings are specified in "search_method" array, the script will print the classes which contains the strings in the name of one or more of their methods.
* If one or more strings are specified in "search_method" and "search_class" array, the script will print only the classes and methods that meet with the search criteria.

## hooking.js
Hooks into methods
* Given one or more classes in "search_class", it hooks into all their methods.
* Given one or more methods in "search_method", it hooks into all methods of any classes that meet with the search criteria.
* Given a class and a method, it hooks into the method of this class.
* Neither class nor method full name is needed in order to hook. If a partial string is given, the script will hook into all the methods that have the string in their name.

## replace.js
Replace methods return values
* Given an especific class, method and value it replaces the return value of the method.
* Method format: for example:  "- isJailbroken:"
* Data must be in the same array position (classNmes, methodNames, returnValues). For example: ['class1','class2']\['method1','method2']['retvalue1','retvalue2']
* If returnValues of a method is left empty, the method will be hooken but the script will not modify the return value.


# PoC
In this section, I will use DVIA iOS application in order to show how can frida and my scripts be used.
Specifically I will analise jailbreak detection test 1. The objective is to bypass the jailbreak detection control.

## Commands
List applications. The ones with a PID are currently active:

With frida-trace, hooking into all methods whose name has the substring "jail":

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LordATM/lordatm.github.io/master/img/2019-08-09-Frida-iOS/trace1.png)

With frida-trace, hooking into all methods of the class JailbreakDetectionVC:

With frida-trace, hooking into an specific method an class:

In order to detect which methods are called, one way is to hook into all methods of a class.
In the following image you can see how the view was loaded first and then the method "jailbreakTest1Tapped:" and "isJailbroken" are called:

Of course, in the device the following message is shown:

## Scripts
Due to the jailbreak detection control only shows an alert text box and it does not terminate the application execution, I will execute the scripts via terminal. Otherwise, I would have used the python script in order to inject the scripts before the applications terminates.

### Find classes
First of all, you should look for classes of your interest. In this example, I have looked for the string "jail" (find_classes.js):
```
var search_class = ['jail'];
```

The only class with the substring "jail" is "JailbreakDetectionVC":

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LordATM/lordatm.github.io/master/img/2019-08-09-Frida-iOS/class1.png)

### Find methods
An other way to find classes is to look into their methods. The only drawback is that depending of the string, a lot of results can be found.
I have looked for the string "jail" in the methods (find_methods.js):
```
var search_class = [''];
var search_method = ['jail'];
```

The class "JailbreakDetectionVC" is in the list, however there are a lot more classes I am not interested in:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LordATM/lordatm.github.io/master/img/2019-08-09-Frida-iOS/methods1.png)

Now that I have detected the class, let's print all its methods (find_methods.js):
```
var search_class = ['JailbreakDetectionVC'];
var search_method = [''];
```
There are a total of 7 methods:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LordATM/lordatm.github.io/master/img/2019-08-09-Frida-iOS/methods2.png)


### Hooking
Now that I know the class, I can hook into the methods in order to understand how are they called (hooking.js):
```
var search_class = ['JailbreakDetectionVC'];
var search_method = [''];
...
	onEnter:
	...
	//print_arguments(args);
```

In the code below, I have commented the line "print_arguments(args);", which prints the arguments send into the methods, because it prints information not needed for this example.

After the script execution, it shows:
1. Calls "jailbreakTest1Tapped:"
2. Calls "isJailbroken"
3. "isJailbroken" returns 0x1
4. "jailbreakTest1Tapped:" returns 0x1035a9d10

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LordATM/lordatm.github.io/master/img/2019-08-09-Frida-iOS/hooking1.png)

I can deduce that "isJailbroken" might be de method which checks if the device is jailbroken due to it returns a "false". 
However, if you want to be sure, static analysis can always be done. Check my post about [bypassing Jailbreak with IDA](https://trelis24.github.io/2019/03/12/Pentesting-iOS-Reversing-Jailbreak/).


### Replace
Finally, I will try to replace the return value of "isJailbroken" so it always returns "false" (replace.js):
```
var classNames = ['JailbreakDetectionVC'];
var methodNames = ['- isJailbroken'];
var returnValues = ['0x0'];
```

The script hooks into the method. When isJailbroken returns the 0x1, frida intercepts it, changes the value to 0x0 and resume the execution:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LordATM/lordatm.github.io/master/img/2019-08-09-Frida-iOS/replace1.png)

After changing the return value from 0x1 to 0x0, the alert textbox is:
