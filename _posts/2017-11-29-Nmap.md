## Description
Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. 




_All the examples have been done with a local machine with IP 192.168.122.136. If you want to try it yourself, you just need to change the IP address._

# Host Discovery
## Pn
```
nmap -Pn 192.168.122.136
```
This flag disable the host discovery Nmap does in order to determine active machines. 
In the following image you can see that Nmap does the TCP handshake before sending the probes. It does the three steps:
- SYN (source - destination)
- SYN ACK (destination - source)
- ACK (source - destination)

However, if you launch Nmap with the flag -Pn, it avoids the handshake and it just starts sending probes:

# Scan Techniques
## sT
```
nmap -sT 192.168.122.136
```
This flag is used by default when Nmap when it doesn't have privileges, it scans TCP ports. In order to send the probes, it uses a system function called `connect()` which makes the scan to go slower than with the flag -sS.

In the following Wireshark screenshot you can see how Nmap scans the port 443. If Nmap is able to make all the steps, it will determine that the port is open:
1. SYN (source - destination)
2. RST SYN (destination - source)
3. SYN (source - destination)
4. RST ACK (destination - source)

It is recommended to use the sT flag if the scan is running inside the network. Because although it is slower, it is more secure than the flag sS.

## sS
```
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.122.136
```
This flag is used by default when Nmap have privileges, it scans TCP ports. It is faster than sT flag because it doesn't use system calls and it doesn't end the connections.

In the following Wireshark screenshot you can see how Nmap scans the port 443. If Nmap receives the RST ACK, it will determine that the port is open:
1. SYN (source - destination)
2. RST SYN (destination - source)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LordATM/lordatm.github.io/master/img/2017-11-29-Nmap/sSWireshark.png)

If instead of the RST SYN Nmap receives an RST, it will determine that the port is closed. And if the target doesn't answer, the port will be marked as filtered.

**IMPORTANT**: It is recommended using Nmap with this flag only when scanning targets from the Internet. Because of Nmap doesn't close the connections, if you scan targets from internal network, it could collapse some firewalls causing a DoS due to internal firewalls have not the same configurations as the external ones and they are more permissive.

## sU
```
sudo namp -sU 192.168.122.136
```
This flag is used to scan UDP ports and it can be combined with sT and sS in order to scan TCP and UDP ports at the same time. 
Scanning UDP ports with Nmap can take long because there are no error controls. When Nmap sends the probe, it waits some milliseconds and send an other one if no answer has been received until it reach a number of tries:
- Open port: target answers with anything
- Closed port: target answers with an ICMP 
- Open/Filtered: if there is no answer Nmap can not determine neither if it is open nor closed

In the following image you can see how Nmap sends some probes until the target answers with an ICMP (port closed):
