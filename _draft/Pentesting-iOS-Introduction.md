A summary of all the commands and things I do during an iOS application static analysis.

# System security
## Security model
Security architecture diagram of iOS provides a visual overview of the different technologies which will be explain in detail in the next sections. 
[IMG architecture]

## Secure boot chain
The iOS secure boot chain system uses secure boot chain mechanism to provide
security in the booting process.

[IMG boot]

* Boot ROM: it contains the Apple root certificate with the authentic public key. Its code is contained in the processor and it can't be updated or changed. It verifies that the LLB is properly signed and it has not been tampered before loading.
* Low-level boot loader (LLB): This is the lowest level of code that can be updated. It also verifies the signatures of firmware of iBoot before loading it.
* iBoot: It verifies the signature of the iOS kernel before starting the kernel. This secure boot chain also prevents any malware that can affect at the boot level.
* Kernel: after all the steps have been verified, the kernel can initialize.

For devices with a Secure Enclave, the Secure Enclave coprocessor 
also utilizes a secure boot process that ensures its separate software 
is verified and signed by Apple. 


## Jailbreak
The objective is to find a vulnerability in one of the steps of the boot chain to gain an maintain root access on the device. 

Attacking this chain of trust is how jailbreaking works. Jailbreak authors need to find a bug somewhere in this chain to disable the verification of the components further down the chain. Exploits of the Boot ROM are the most desirable because this is the one component Apple can’t change in a software update.

Basically, there are two types of jailbreak, described as follows:
* Tethered: In tethered jailbreak, every time we reboot the device, we need to
connect iDevice to the system in order to jailbreak it
* Untethered: In untethered jailbreak, we just need to jailbreak the device once
and then we can use it at all time


## Crypto engine
Since the release of the iPhone 3GS, Apple has built encryption into the hardware and firmware of its iPads and iPhones. Every iOS device now has a dedicated Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit crypto engine that sits between the flash storage and main system memory. The engine works in conjunction with the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function -- which is implemented in the hardware as well -- to reduce overhead for cryptographic operations.


## Secure enclave
The Secure Enclave is a coprocessor which uses encrypted memory and includes a hardware random number generator. The Secure 
Enclave provides all cryptographic operations for Data Protection key management and maintains the integrity of Data Protection even if the kernel has been compromised. Communication between the Secure Enclave and the application processor is isolated to an interrupt-driven 
mailbox and shared memory data buffers.

The Secure Enclave is also responsible for processing fingerprint and face data from the Touch ID and Face ID sensors, determining if there’s a match, and then enabling access or purchases on behalf of the user.


# Encryption and Data Protection
## Sandbox
Applications are shunted into a virtual container that consists of detailed rules specifying which system resources a subject is allowed to access, such as network resources, file read and writes, the ability to fork processes, and so on. On OS X you can control some of how your application is sandboxed, but on iOS all third-party applications are run with a single restrictive policy.

In terms of file access, processes are generally confined to their own application bundle directory; they can read and write only the files stored there.


## File Data Protection
Every time a file on the data partition is created, Data Protection creates a new 256-bit key (the File key [5]) and gives it to the hardware AES engine, which uses the key to encrypt the file as it is written to flash memory using AES CBC mode.
It is used to encrypt the file contents. This key is stored in the files's metadata.The Class Key [4] is a dedicated key for a particular Data Protection class so that files classified with different protection levels use separate cryptographic keys. 

The Filesystem Key [3] is a global encryption key used to encrypt the file’s security-related metadata after the metadata is encrypted by the Class Key.

The Device Key [1], also known as the UID key, is unique for each device and accessible only by the hardware AES engine, not by the OS itself. This is the master key of the system, as it were, which encrypts the Filesystem Key and the Class Keys.

The User Passcode [2], if enabled, is combined with the Device Key when encrypting Class Keys.

## Data protection classes
* NSFileProtectionComplete: The class key is protected with a key derived from the user passcode and the device UID. Shortly after the
user locks a device (10 seconds, if the Require Password setting is Immediately), the decrypted class key is discarded, rendering all data in this class inaccessible until the user enters the passcode again or unlocks the device using Touch ID or Face ID.
* NSFileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen: Some files may need to be written while the device is locked. A good example of this is a mail
attachment downloading in the background.
* NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication: This class behaves in the same way as Complete Protection, except that the
decrypted class key isn’t removed from memory when the device is locked. The protection in this class has similar properties to desktop full-volume encryption, and protects data from attacks that involve a reboot. This is the default class for all third-party app data not otherwise assigned to a Data Protection class.
* NSFileProtectionNone* : This class key is protected only with the UID,
and is kept in Effaceable Storage. Since all the keys needed to decrypt files
in this class are stored on the device, the encryption only affords the benefit
of fast remote wipe. If a file isn’t assigned a Data Protection class, it is still
stored in encrypted form (as is all data on an iOS device).

## Keychain Data Protection
Many apps need to handle passwords and other short but sensitive bits of data, such as keys and login tokens. The iOS Keychain provides a secure way to store these items.

Keychain data is protected using a class structure similar to the one used in file Data Protection. These classes have behaviors equivalent to file Data Protection classes, but use distinct keys and are part of APIs that are named differently.

[IMG keychain]

* **NSFileProtectionComplete**: The file is stored in an encrypted format on disk and cannot be read from or written to while the device is locked or booting. If this options is not set, sensible data can be saved in iCloud or iTunes during automatic backups.
* **kSecAtrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock**: the data remains accessible until the next restart. This is recommended for items that need to be accessed by background applications.
* **kSecAttrAccessibleAlways**: The data in the keychain item can always be accessed regardless of whether the device is locked. Not recommended.
* **kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly**: The data in the keychain can only be accessed when the device is unlocked. Only available if a passcode is set on the device. This is recommended for items that only need to be accessible while the application is in the foreground.


# App Security
## Application signing
Once the iOS kernel has started, it controls which user processes and apps can be run. To ensure that all apps come from a known and
approved source and haven’t been tampered with, iOS requires that all executable code be signed using an Apple-issued certificate. Mandatory code signing extends the concept of chain of trust from the OS to apps, and prevents third-party apps from loading unsigned code resources or using self-modifying code.

Unlike other mobile platforms, iOS doesn’t allow users to install potentially malicious unsigned apps from websites, or run untrusted
code. At runtime, code signature checks of all executable memory pages are made as they are loaded to ensure that an app hasn’t been modified since it was installed or last updated.

* This will be needed to be taken into account if the binary is modified during the test.

## Runtime process security
Once an app is verified to be from an approved source, iOS enforces security measures designed to prevent it from compromising other apps
or the rest of the system.

All third-party apps are “sandboxed,” so they are restricted from accessing files stored by other apps or from making changes to the
device. This prevents apps from gathering or modifying information stored by other apps. Each app has a unique home directory for its files, which is randomly assigned when the app is installed. If a third-party app needs to access information other than its own, it does so only by using services explicitly provided by iOS.


# App Execution Flow

# Objective C
## MVC design
The iOS applications are bases on the Model-View-Controller design. This concept is really useful while performing dynamic analysis.
[IMG mvc]

* View displays the information that is contained in the Model. However, they do not communicate directly due to the controller is needed.
* Model: Model contains the data. The Model objects obtain the data either from a database or the files that could be located locally or externally.
* Controller: It acts as a mediator between Model and View, so all communication happens through Controller
