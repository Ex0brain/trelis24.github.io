## About Me
I am working as a Pentester in a company where I have the luck to collaborate in different projects. I audit websites, infrastructure, iOS applications and ATMs.

On my own, now I am focusing in learning infraestructure pentesting and privilege escalation and active directory. 

## Why this blog
This blog is a way to organize myself because I write down a lot of things while I work. The objective is to post everything I learn or I thing is useful, so I can search it faster when needed.

## Content of the blog
I will publish information I use during the day, most of them will be related with cibersecurity. Usually it will be:
- Web vulnerabilities / exploits
- Infrastructures vulnerabilities / exploits
- iOS vulnerabilities
- Reversing in iOS
- CTF
- Network
- Post Explotation
