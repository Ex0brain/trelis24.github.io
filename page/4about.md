## About Me
I am working as a Pentester in a company where I have the luck to work in differents projects. I do auditories in websites, infrastructure, iOS applications and ATMs.

On my own, now I am focusing in learning reversing with the objective to get better during iOS pentesting. 

## Why this blog
This blog is a way to organize myself because I write down everything I do. The objective I have is to post everything I learn or I thing is useful, so I can search it faster when needed.

## Content of the blog
I don't have an especific type of content. I will publish information I use during the day. Usually it will be:
- Web vulnerabilites / exploits
- Infrastructures vulnerabilities / exploits
- iOS vulnerabilities
- Reversing in iOS
- CTF
